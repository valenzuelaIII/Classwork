1. Makefile: a Makefile containing macros for compiling, cleaning, checking, and submitting the source files for PA3. If you would like to compile DictionaryTest, use command:
	%make test
to compile an executable jarfile DictionaryTest. To clean the jarfile and associated classes, use command:
	%make cleantest

2. Dictionary.java: Implementation file for Dictionary ADT

3. DictionaryTest.java: Contains isolation tests for various parts of Dictionary ADT

4. DuplicateKeyException.java: defines exception class Duplicate Key to be thrown by Dictionary ADT 

5. KeyNotFoundException.java: defines exception class Key Not Found to be thrown by Dictionary ADT

6. DictionaryInterface.java: Interface file (unchanged)

7. DictionaryClient.java: Client file (unchanged)

Please note: Ignore the file Makefile1 that was originally included in first submission. This was used until a Makefile was modified for test compiling.
